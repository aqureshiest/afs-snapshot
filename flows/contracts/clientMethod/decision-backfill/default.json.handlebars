{{!
  This backfill contract expects the first action to be a decision-request
  and only triggers if the first applicant has a monolithLoanID

  This contract checks to make sure that the decision request is not in its
  pre-evaluation state.

  TODO: it would be nice if the contract template-helper was able to
  conditionally withold results if `isIncomplete` is true. This might make it
  easier to prevent evaluative contracts from propagating up their own internal
  instructions
